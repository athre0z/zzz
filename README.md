Yet another progress bar library.

```toml
[dependencies]
zzz = { version = "*" }
```

## Core values

- Convenient application to iterators and streams
- Doesn't slow down your loop, pretty much no matter how simple the subject
  of the progress bar is, on average a ...
    - `!Sync` progress bar update is 4 instructions (3 CPU cycles on Skylake)
    - ` Sync` progress bar update is also 4 instructions (38 CPU cycles on Skylake[^1])
- Automagically determines and updates a good printing frequency
- Looks pretty decent out of the box

[^1]: For multi-threaded loops, cycle counts may vary 

## Usage examples

Looping over an iterator with a progress bar:
```rust
fn main() {
    //                            vvvvv
    for _ in (0..1000).into_iter().pb() {
        sleep(Duration::from_millis(10));
    }
}
```
