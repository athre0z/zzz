```toml

zzz = { version = "0.1" }
```

## Features

- Practical defaults
- Seamless integration with iterators and streams
  - If possible, `zzz` infers the target size from `size_hint()`
- Automagically determines and updates a good printing frequency
- Very low overhead: doesn't slow down your loop, pretty much no matter how simple the loop body. On average a ...
    - `!Sync` progress bar update is 4 instructions (on average, 3 CPU cycles on Skylake)
    - ` Sync` progress bar update is also 4 instructions (on average, 38 CPU cycles on Skylake)
  
## Cargo Features
- `streams`: Enables support for `.progress()` on async streams (`futures::streams::Stream`)

## Usage examples

Adding a progress bar to an iterator:
```rust
use zzz::ProgressBarIterExt as _;

//                             vvvvvvvv
for _ in (0..1000).into_iter().progress() {
    // ...
}
```

Manually creating and advancing a progress bar:
```rust
use zzz::ProgressBar;

let mut pb = ProgressBar::with_target(1234);
for i in 0..1234 {
    // ...
    pb.add(1);
}
```
